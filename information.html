										<h3>Yemen Crisis</h3>
										<p>
                                            <h4>Background and Causes</h4>
										</p>
										<p>The Yemen Crisis is a conflict between the Yemeni government and Saudi-led military, and Iran-backed <b>Houthi</b> rebels. 
											The US and several European countries support the government. 
											The crisis began in July 2014 when the Yemeni government lifted fuel subsidies. 
											As a result, fuel prices went up. In response to this, Houthis organized protests demanding lower fuel prices and a new government. 
											By mid-September 2014, the Houthi had control of Yemen’s capital, Sanaa.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
											In 2015, al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP) took the city of Mukalla and released 300 prisoners held there. 
											They also took parts of the port city of Aden, but lost them in April of 2016. 
											The group has gained support in Yemen, as they have provided citizens with services they aren’t receiving from the government. 
										</p>
										<p>
                                            <h4>Current Status of Crisis/Recent Developments</h4>
										</p>
										<p>The Houthi still control Sanaa. In August of 2019, the <b>Southern Transitional Council (STP)</b> took Aden. 
											In November, the STP and the Yemeni government developed the Riyadh Agreement. 
											It said that factions would have an equal share of power in post-war Yemen. 
											However, for part of 2020 separatists didn’t adhere to this agreement; they declared self-rule in southern areas they still held. 
											In July, they rejoined the agreement. Peace talks have started to make progress, but have ultimately been unsuccessful.
                                        </p>
                                        <p>
                                            <a href="#" class="link"><img src="images/Yemen_Map.png" alt="" width="75%" height="75%" /></a>
										</p>
										<p>
                                            <h4>Effects</h4>
										</p>
										<p>As a result of this crisis, more than 24 million people (80% of Yemen’s population) are in need of humanitarian aid, including 12 million children. 
											Around 4 million people have been displaced and over 100,000 people have died since 2015. US airstrikes have killed more than 100 civilians. 
											Other effects of the crisis have been cholera outbreaks, medicine shortages, and threats of famine.
                                        </p>
